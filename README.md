# Douglas-fir Genomics Pipeline

Here I have including all of the final versions of the scripts I used for the interior Douglas-fir genomics projects out of the Booker lab.

```sh
#The code used to build the intDF011 assembly (not CBP):
./intDF011_pipeline.sh

#Assembly quality statistics for CBP and coastal assembliues, as well as Hi-C contact maps for interior assemblies:
./assembly_quality_assessment.sh
```
